# Context Budget

Use this policy to keep token load small.

1. Read only `references/routing-table.md` first.
2. Read only one reference file based on intent.
3. Run scripts for deterministic behavior.
4. Do not open multiple references unless output is insufficient.
5. Never duplicate formulas; treat `references/formulas.md` as the single source of truth.

## Suggested Max Loading Per Task
- Router reference: 1 file
- Domain reference: 1 file
- Optional extra reference: 1 file
- Prefer script execution over loading additional docs.
